Team Liaison</b>

<u>Week of 2/7/16 - 2/13/16</u>
<br>
<p>
This week, our team met after class on Monday to discuss what we interpreted as the requirements for the project. By Tuesday evening, each of us proposed a list of specifications for the project individually, which I compiled before emailing to the the client, Dr. Julie Whitney, for review. Dr. Whitney sent her approval of the specifications the next morning, providing us with a concrete set of goals to work towards. The team met once again after class on Friday to discuss our personal responsibilities, and set some goals for the following week. In the coming week, we are to individually review the cafe data and identify trends.
