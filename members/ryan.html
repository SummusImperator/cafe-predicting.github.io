<u>Week of 2/7/16 - 2/13/16</u>
<p>This week, we met after class to discuss the requirements for our project and the plan moving forward. We each sent a list of what we believed to be the requirements to Cory who then compiled the list and forwared it to the client, Dr. Whitney, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday I set up the Github project profile and started our project webpage. Dr. Whitney then approved our requirements we had sent by Wednesday, which were then added to the webpage. After class on Friday, we discussed the overall theme of the website which I implemented the basics of by Friday and continued tweaking over the weekend. Content for the project's abstract, description, requirements, schedule, and activities were added by Friday.</p>
<p>After class on Friday we met and decided for the coming week to review the cafe data and each identify our own possible trends to submit to the customer.</p>
