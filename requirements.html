			<li>The product will offer an interactive dashboard which depicts and predicts customer activity at a given caf&#233; over a user-modifiable time scale and customer demographic range.</li>
			<li>The dashboard should feature a sign-in page for security purposes.</li>
			<li>The display of the dashboard should be non-technical and user-friendly, able to be understood by a layperson.</li>
			<li>The product should provide prediction models for at least three aspects of customer activity, possibly including customer population, demographics, and product purchases based on time of day, day of week, or weather patterns.</li>
			<li>During development, each team member will generate a prediction model using machine learning algorithms of his/her choice, focusing on a unique aspect of customer activity.</li>
			<li>Only the most accurate model will need to be included in the final product.</li>
			<li>Each model should achieve at least 80% accuracy in its predictions.</li>
